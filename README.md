# IntervalAnalysis
Python codes for Interval Analysis methods as a project done for the graduate lesson "Introduction to Interval Analysis" (tutor: T.N.Grapsa) at Mathematics Department, University of Patras (2016-2017)
This repository includes the codes for:
The basic operations between intervals. 
Bisection Method for finding all intervals containing roots.
Newton Method (and Extended Newton Method) for finding the roots at a given interval.
Krawczyk Method for finding an interval containing all the roots (or the exact root at several cases) of a given function.
MRF Algorithm for finding an interval containing the minimum root of a given function.
Accelarating devices (midpoint test, monotonicity test, concavity test, interval newton step) for global optimization algorithms.
Hansen Method for finding global minimum (and maximum) of a function of 2 variables.
